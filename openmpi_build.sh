# Function to find a patch file in the plfs source tree that is suitable for a
# given version of Open MPI. It will modify the variable PATCH_FILE so that the
# result can be easily used by the calling process. This function prints out
# messages as it works, so capturing its stdout isn't enough to get the patch
# file.
#
# Since a single patch file can cover several versions of Open MPI
# (signified by the use of an x in the version string in the patch file name),
# we have to figure out which patch file can be used with the given version of
# Open MPI.
#
# Usage:
# find_patchfile VER
#
# Input:
# - VER: version of Open MPI that we are working with.
#
# Return values:
# - 0: Suitable patch file found successfully
# - 1: Suitable patch file not found
#
# Output:
# - various status messages to stdout
# - PATCH_FILE: this variable will possibly contain, after executing this
#   function, a path to a suitable patch file. The path will be relative to the
#   plfs source directory. This variable should be set before calling this
#   function and then can be used after this function returns. It is not
#   initialized by this function and will not modify it if a suitable patch is
#   not found.
